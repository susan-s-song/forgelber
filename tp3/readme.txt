Hamburg Sushi
A cooking game in which you drag and drop ingredients to serve to customers who have unique orders each time. You set up the positions
where you want the customers to walk in and everytime you replay the format of the game is randomly generated, so the table could be in
a different position or orientation, along with the couch, doors, fridge, etc. The waiter must bring the food directly to the
customers through keypresses. After a certain amount of time in which a customer's order is not satisifed, they will leave and once
10 customers leave you lose the game. There will be a second round with an addition of new dishes served.
